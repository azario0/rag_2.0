This workshop introduces advanced Python programming concepts through the creation and explanation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Participants will learn the essential components of RAG, implement a system, and understand its applications in modern AI.
What participants will learn:
● Fundamentals of RAG systems and their applications
● Document processing and embedding creation techniques
● Working with vector databases (e.g., FAISS)
● Query processing and retrieval mechanisms
● Prompt engineering for effective RAG implementation
● Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs)
